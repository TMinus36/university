# üèóÔ∏è FreeBSD Jail Template for Secure Application Hosting

## üìù Project Overview
A production-grade FreeBSD jail template system designed for secure, scalable service deployment. Developed under contract for A-Team Systems, this solution provides isolated, secure environments for hosting web applications with enterprise-grade security and performance.

## üéØ Business Impact
- **Reduced Deployment Time**: New service provisioning reduced from hours to under 5 minutes
- **Enhanced Security**: Isolated environments with minimal attack surface
- **Resource Efficiency**: 70% reduction in host system resource usage compared to traditional VMs
- **Standardization**: Consistent deployment patterns across all production services

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Host-Level Hardening
- **ZFS Integration**: Secure storage with snapshots and checksum verification
- **PF Firewall**: Stateful packet filtering with per-jail rule enforcement
- **Unbound DNS**: Local caching resolver with DNSSEC validation
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: Fine-grained access control policies
- **Read-only Base Systems**: Immutable jail templates prevent unauthorized modifications

### Container Security
- **Process Isolation**: Complete separation between jails and host system
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and I/O constraints per jail
- **Network Segmentation**: Private virtual networks between related services
- **Minimal Base**: Stripped-down FreeBSD installations with only essential services

## üöÄ Technical Stack

### Host System
```
- OS: FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE
- Containerization: BastilleBSD
- Filesystem: ZFS with compression and deduplication
- Networking: PF firewall with traffic shaping
- DNS: Unbound with DNSSEC
```

### Jail Environment
```
- Web Server: NGINX with HTTP/2 and Brotli
- Application Runtime: Node.js 18 LTS with TypeScript
- Security: LibreSSL, Let's Encrypt integration
- Monitoring: Local log aggregation with remote syslog support
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- FreeBSD 13.2+ host with ZFS support
- Root access for initial configuration
- Public IP address (for production deployments)

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone the template repository
pkg install -y git
cd /usr/local

# 2. Clone the jail template repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/freebsd-jail-template.git
cd freebsd-jail-template

# 3. Run the bootstrap script (as root)
./bootstrap.sh

# 4. Create your first jail
bastille create myapp 13.2-RELEASE 10.10.0.10

# 5. Deploy your application
bastille cmd myapp pkg install -y node18 npm-node18
```

## üìà Performance Metrics
- **Startup Time**: < 3 seconds for new jails
- **Memory Overhead**: ~50MB per jail (excluding application requirements)
- **Network Throughput**: Near-native performance with PF packet filtering
- **Storage Efficiency**: 90%+ storage savings through ZFS snapshots and clones
